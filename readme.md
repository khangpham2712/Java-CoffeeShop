## Assignment

### Problem statement

Write a program for a coffee shop.

### Requirements

- A beverage can be added many topping
- Order statuses can be send to chat apps (telegram, zalo, ...)
- Bill can be printed or send to chat apps (telegram, zalo, ...)

### Technical requirements

- Use design patterns, as much as possible
- Program is implemented on standard output
- Input could be standard input or hardcode in main function
- No database is required
- Unittest is a must
- Unittest coverage must above 80%
- Must use a mock framework
- Programming languages: Java, Python, Golang, Javascript, Scala
- Must use git and the graph must shows the working progress

### Solution

Source code is written in Java and Unit Tests are written with JUnit5 and a little bit of Mockito. Highly recommend using IntelliJ.

Techniques used:
- Flexibly using java concepts such as collections, enums, interfaces and so on
- Making use of all four priciples of object-oriented programming which are **abstraction**, **encapsulation**, **inheritance** and **polymorphism**
- Design patterns used: **factory**, **decorator**, **observer**, **singleton** and **state**
- Clean code (naming conventions, coding style ...)
